It will be fetched asynchronously after the REST call returns. The audio can be mono or stereo.audio_channel is used to specify audio channels if the media is a stereo file. A value of left or right signifies that only the specified channel will be used. If no value or an empty string is specified for audio_channel, all channels will be used in a single track. If your stereo channels were recorded separately with each channel containing distinct content (for example if 2 legs of a phone call were recorded separately and combined into a single stereo file), for best speech recognition, create two tracks, with audio_channel set to left and right in each track respectively. If your stereo file is simply a recording made with a stereo microphone, audio_channel should be set to an empty string (or not be specified.) If you have audio channels as separate media files, after creating the bundle with one media_url, POST another media_url to /bundles/{bundle_id}/tracks.audio_language can be used to specify the language of the audio media. This is an optional parameter and if not specified or an empty string, the language of the track will be automatically detected. If specified, it must be a language code as described in RFC5646 (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646). Supported languages: en-US, en-UK, es, fr.label is a short name for the track.metadata is a single-level JSON object of your own definition, containing key-values that can be searched and filtered on. Metadata can be used to hold text such as names, titles, descriptions and values for segregating bundles, for example by user, topic, folder name etc. The keys (property names) can be up to 64 characters and must contain only alphanumeric characters and underscore (but not start with underscore) and must not be a reserved name. Reserved names are &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, and &quot;null&quot;. Values can be strings, numbers, boolean true/false, date-times represented as a string in ISO 8601 format (ex. &quot;2014-02-25T14:23:45.000Z&quot;), or an array of these primitive types. Strings can be up to 2000 characters and strings in arrays can be up to 128 characters each. Nested objects are not allowed. Metadata can contain up to 50 key-value pairs up to a total JSON size of 4000 characters.start_time a time in seconds that the media starts, relative to start time of the bundle. This allows you to specify sequential parts of media. If not specified, the default is 0.parts_pending a boolean flag specifying if more media parts will subsequently be added to the track. If true, a subsequent API call must be made to signify that the track is complete. If not specified, the default is false.external_id is an optional parameter that can be used to logically link a bundle to an item in an external system. The external_id can be whatever you use to identify items in your own database.notify_url is a webhook. It must be a publicly accessible url (http or https) on your server to which notifications for the bundle will be POSTed. There are three types of notifications: Track Notifications, Insight Notifications and Bundle Notifications. For more information on the content of notifications and when they are sent, see the notification docs page.If a track was created along with the budle, the link relation clarify:track will be included with a link to the new track."

This will insert or append a new track in the tracks array or return an error if the maximum number of tracks (12) has been reached or the track number specifies an invalid index.Once all media parts have been added to a track it is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified. If you wish to modify a track, simply add a new one and delete the existing one.label is a short name for the track.media_url must be a publicly accessible url to a media file. It will be fetched asynchronously after the REST call returns. The audio can be mono or stereo.audio_channel is used to specify audio channels if the media is a stereo file. A value of left or right signifies that only the specified channel will be used. If no value or an empty string is specified for audio_channel, all channels will be used in a single track. If your stereo channels were recorded separately with each channel containing distinct content (for example if 2 legs of a phone call were recorded separately and combined into a single stereo file), for best speech recognition, create two tracks with audio_channel to be left and right. If your stereo file is simply a recording made with a stereo microphone, audio_channel should be set to an empty string (or not be specified.)audio_language can be used to specify the language of the audio media. This is an optional parameter and if not specified or an empty string, the language of the track will be automatically detected. If specified, it must be a language code as described in RFC5646 (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646). Supported languages: en-US, en-UK, es, fr.start_time a time in seconds that the media starts, relative to start time of the bundle. This allows you to specify sequential parts of media. If not specified, the default is 0.parts_pending a boolean flag specifying if more media parts will subsequently be added to the track. If true, a subsequent API call must be made to signify that the track is complete. If not specified, the default is false.track is the index in the tracks array where the new track will be added. Track numbers start at 0. If this parameter is not specified the new track will always be appended to the end of the array. If the track specified is greater than the last index of the array + 1, an error will be returned.If version specified, the track will only be added if the current version matches this parameter value. If the version doesn't match, a 409 Conflict error will be returned. If version not specified, the track will always be updated."
