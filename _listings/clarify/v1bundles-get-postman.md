If the results are exactly one page neither prev nor next will be available.The embed parameter specifies link relations to embed in the results. The models for the specified link relations will be in an array in the embedded object with the link relation as the key. For example, if you do embed=items, _embedded will contain a property items whose value is the array of bundle models. For link relations that are curies (ex. \"clarify:metadata\"), you may simply use the base name (ex. \"metadata\").",
